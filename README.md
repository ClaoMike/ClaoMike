- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClaoMike, a second year computer science student at The University of Manchester.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... everything. Web and Game Development are my favourite topics. But I can do more.
- 🌱 I’m currently(/always) learning Java, C, C++, Pythton, Spring, JavaFX, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Dart, Latex, Unity, libGDX ... and a lot of other stuff!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. You have a project and need +1 programmer to help you, I am in. I love to learn new things so, do not worry what you are looking for is not listed above. :)
